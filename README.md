# C++ template

Shared template for all my personal C++ projects.

Currently requires CMake 3.28+ and C++23.

## Getting started

Replace across the project all occurrences of `the_project_name` to a desired project name. This can be done manually.

Build commands:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
